# ES-Project

This repository contains the code generated for the Embedded Systems Course project.
There are different mains for the different measurements we have done to characterize the behavior of the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kit board by STMicroelectronics.

Each code is derived from the example code available with the board on the STM32 Cube IDE.

## main.c

It's the original example code.
